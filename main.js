//add static method to create a new field, and a static method to check a field's solvability. Then set a field variable inside the game object as that static method and change it if a new field is requ3ested
//problem is that I want to have game be it's own game with it's own stats object that can be added to the player stats and a new game is made. Maybe inside the player object their should be a new method newGame which makes a new board with new stats, which then makes a new field.
//add a method that somehow exports the current stats from game and saves them to the player array

//* create static method on Field to create a random field 
//*Is there a way to remove the waiting prompt and display the "here we go text under the new board for example?"
//make sure when adding new field that it somehow keeps the first loss status of the previous field. This is moved to player, once player is integrated change where it checks for the status to the correct player object
//*change all instances of holes and path etc to the characters, maybe make them properites of Field objects too. That way it's easier to change if i want to in the future
//*Add green and brown for path and grass
// after a stats file is made the comp should say "You came back! Would you like to see your stats or play another round?"
//add arrays for dialogs to pull from
//add logic for accepting input without hitting enter
//add out of bounds logic
//maybe dont need variable names for new objects like player, just add them to an array to be accessed by index, same for games in the game object within player
//add logic to check starting position based on where the new field shows the person
//move all dialog to dialog/prompt
//add instant input
