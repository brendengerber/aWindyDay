//Make draw a function out of objects
//use draw with defaults xy to zero
//use a state object containing xy counter instead of separate variables
//use draw in draw fields
//make an assets object. House has two states and a counter
//make a state object that contains coordinates and counters and states for everything, when should this be set? when difficulty is set? Is it possible to have a difficulty object defined at the beginning where all of these tweaks can be made? Then when selecting a 

//difficulty object that contains an object for each difficulty. those objects will have field size and holes, and another object for states.  The game object will have a constructor that uses the difficulty argument to access the different difficulties 

//Inspired by maze craze

//Next add while loops for the inputs
//maybe use events to update the play field, then an animation can print the play field each frame, and the play field will be updated asychrnously throughout
