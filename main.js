//add first game of session and skip the explanation after that
//can console.clear be moved into methods?

//Do the interview stuff

//add or remove bind notes


//make field and fence offsets populate automatically based on field size if possible

// NEXT 
// should color and possition be methods on draw, or each asset?
// maybe position sprite should not be a method of  each asset. Draw should loop through and draw each sprite (and possition them), based on the current state. That means move position sprite out of the asset. Should all be called using a loop in the composite stage. That way to add an object, you just have to add the object and the state, you dont have to updtade draw, position, and color too. Draw frame can loop through all assets, color them, and then possition/layer them. It will be a loop so that assets dont have to be called individually. The functions can take in the state object, and the asset array. Each asset it checks it's state. colors it, possitions it, and at the end draws it all.  state[asset].color can work for all of them

// FINAL
// update will be a function that calls all the assets update methods, draw will be a function that calls all of the assets draw methods, adding them to an array which will then be composited using the draw method.  Should draw be a method of each asset with position and color? could be nice symetry for calling all the update methods by a loop.
// each draw method on the assets will consist of a possition call and color call. Both calls are methods of draw. Call color first inside of possition. Each take an array and return an array. Color returns a new version of the stock, which is the array arg for possition which returns a colored and possitioned.

// For interview, might be good to eliminate hidden field. Make field an asset. Can create field based on the array made by generate valid field. But each space is an object, frame is grass, and a state for hole and hat as well. check move then checks the state of that object.
// alternatively i can set the field asset rather than a field property. that field object can have a state object that is the current field and the hidden field. then check move checks the state to see the validity of the move. 
// either way would want to add field to assets and remove the function that draws it in the draw current frame method.
//**The way to do this is move field to assets. then have it build the field like the other assets (only need one class then), might be nice to move hidden field to the state and have isHole and isHat check the state. For sure move it to assets though and have it construct like an asset. And put the update method in the class directly too. */
//Constructor sets frame asset rather than frame property
//Make sure field still gets saved to gameStats, where is that happening?

// add emotions convo, makes him more quarky and grumpy
// Make sure there is an explanation about hwo the sprites work using invisible margins

// have an old offset and a new offset, if new offset = old offset, then do not redraw possitioned sprite. If update changes new offset, then redraw the sprite

// in a perfect world I would make each grass it's own object. Have the object contain if it has a hole. Then when landing on that grid space, would run a check to see. That would allow me to have larger assets.  Game could be a grid with the center of the objects on the grid point and the assets bounce from one to the next and check other objects with that state. could even make hitboxes that way by having their state contain several points connected to the middle.
