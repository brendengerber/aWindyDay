//* create static method on Field to create a random field or a seperate module
//*do prompt functions belong in the class? maybe as module functions assigned to methods. for now they all work outside of it fine so could be a module
//*Is there a way to remove the waiting prompt and display the "here we go text under the new board for example?"
//IMPORTANT After winning or losing one time, if you answer you don't want to play again the game restarts regardless, while showing the previous board. maybe prompt functions must reset the answer again so it's ready for a new prommpt. winning or losing after the bug causes correct behavior
//seems the problem is in resetGame as it happens with a n answer even after removing playAgainPrompt
//possibly it jumps back into the while loop, maybe can fix by turning play game into an object with loop and check methods so they dont run sequentially down
//maybe add a property which is an object containing game functions
//make sure when adding new field that it somehow keeps the first loss status of the previous field. maybe it should just be a global variable
//*change all instances of holes and path etc to the characters, maybe make them properites of Field objects too. That way it's easier to change if i want to in the future
//*Add green and brown for path and grass
//make intro dialog only return and not start the process, then have a function called start game which calls that prompt and runs the loop if it returns y
//add arrays for different things for the comp to say
//Differentiate between dialogs and yes no prompt
// after a stats file is made the comp should say "You came back! Would you like to see your stats or play another round?"
//add arrays for dialogs to pull from

//create a player class. this player should have the info of the player, as well as a stats property containing an object which contains all of the stats (wins, losses, moves per game). There should also be a set stats method, which uses the current stats and has an argument of "newStats", it should update stats without looping through all previous games. Finally this class should have a games property, set to an array of all the games played. The games class will create an object and push it to this array, this should include a game id, and the stats for that game

//add start dialog to start game method, if it is just used to return y or n then it can be a module/function, and the begin game actually runs in the method
//make a new object in play game? the object can contain x and y stuff, plus start game, play loop, etc

//add out of bounds logic

//change all dialogs to return y or to activate playGame(). If all are set to return y or n, then in the game class method i may need to call it and then add if statements. If they all return y or n then they should also go into their own object
